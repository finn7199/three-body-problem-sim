# üåå Real Time N-Body Gravitational Simulator

This project is a **real-time, interactive 3D simulation** of the N-body problem, built in **C++** and **OpenGL**.  
It features a **physics engine** and a **multi-pass rendering pipeline** with  visual effects to create a beautiful and physically plausible visualization of celestial mechanics.

## ‚ú® Key Features
### Physics Engine
- **Multiple Integrators**: Implementations for Euler, Leapfrog, and Runge-Kutta 4th Order for comparative analysis.  
- **Energy Conservation Verification**: Logging system to plot and verify that RK4 and Leapfrog conserve total system energy.  
- **Modular Scenarios**: Flexible system for loading different initial conditions.  

### Rendering Engine
- **OpenGL**: Renderer using OpenGL.  
- **HDR & Post-Processing**: Multi-pass pipeline rendering to an HDR framebuffer to support advanced effects.  
- **Blinn-Phong Lighting**: Robust and efficient direct illumination.  
- **Image-Based Lighting (IBL)**: Pre-computed irradiance maps from the skybox for realistic ambient light.  
- **Bloom**: Separable Gaussian blur for a beautiful glow around emissive objects.  
- **Particle System**: Dynamic trails to visualize orbital paths of celestial bodies.
